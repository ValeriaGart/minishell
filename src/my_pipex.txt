What am i actually doing in pipex:

1) Checking if heredoc is 2d args;
2) Sending to filecheck 2 times
    2.1) Checking if there is heredoc:
            Yes -> simulate heredoc , read from standard input;
            No  -> read from the file;
    2.2) Checking if there is heredoc:
            Yes -> list->file2 = open(av[ac - 1], O_WRONLY | O_CREAT | O_APPEND, 0000644);
            No  -> list->file2 = open(av[ac - 1], O_TRUNC | O_CREAT | O_RDWR, 0000644);
3) Checking if there is line with PATHS in envp, assigning paths to str;
4) Spliting paths with ':';
5)
